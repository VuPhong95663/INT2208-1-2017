1
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.010
Right from the start

2
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.930
You were a thief
You stole my heart

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.710
And I your willing victim

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.980
I let you see the parts

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.710
Of me that weren't all that pretty

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.810
And with every touch you fixed them

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.790
Now you've been talkin' in your sleep

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.050
Uh-oh. things you never say to me

9
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.030
Uh-oh. tell me that you've had enough

10
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.100
Of our love. our love

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.540
Just give me a reason

12
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.030
Just a little bit's enough

13
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.670
Just a second. we're not broken just bent

14
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.210
And we can learn to love again

15
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.170
It's in the stars. it's been written in the scars
On our hearts

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.830
We're not broken. just bent

17
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.370
And we can learn to love again

18
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.640
I'm sorry I don't understand

19
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.870
Where all of this is coming from

20
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.510
I thought that we were fine

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.520
Oh. we had everything

22
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
Your head is running wild again

23
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.960
My dear. we still have everythin'

24
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.750
And it's all in your mind

25
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.750
Yeah. but this is happenin'

26
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.780
You've been havin' real bad dreams

27
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.960
Uh-oh. you used to lie so close to me

28
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.990
Uh-oh. there's nothing more than empty sheets

29
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.020
Between our love. our love

30
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.950
Oh. our love. our love. (oh)!

31
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.820
Just give me a reason

32
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.120
Just a little bit's enough

33
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.840
Just a second. we're not broken just bent

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.420
And we can learn to love again

35
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.620
I never stop. you're still written in the scars
on my heart

36
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.020
You're not broken just bent

37
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.780
And we can learn to love again

38
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.080
Oh tear ducts and rust

39
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.490
I'll fix it for us

40
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.710
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough

41
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.290
You're holding it in

42
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.930
You're pouring a drink

43
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.000
No. nothing is as
Bad... as... it... seems

44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.440
We'll come clean!

45
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.310
Just give me a reason

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.660
